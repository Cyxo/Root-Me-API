## Description

[Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en) is a french platform that is the fast, easy, and affordable way to train your hacking skills. This website provides hundreds of challenges to train yourself in different and not simulated environments, offering you a way to learn a lot of hacking technics. \
It also provides dozens of virtual environments, accessible with a few clicks, to give you a realistic learning environment, without any limitation.

The purpose of this project is to provide an API to use 
[Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en) data, provide a discord bot fetching events and data from this API and to build a distributed system thanks to workers using [redis streams and consumer groups](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).

Using different worker instances is necessary to increase performance because
Root-Me website is blocking the requests if it detects too much connections
incoming from a specific public IP (You get an HTTP error code: "429 Too Many Requests"). \
(See advanced configuration).

## How does it works ? 

When a client is making a request on the API, the server is checking if there is existing data in an associated [redis key](https://redis.io/commands/getset). If not, the server is sending a task to workers through the appropriate [redis stream](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro). If there is existing data, the API is checking if the last update is not too old (depends on `UPDATE_TIMEOUT` in [constants.py](https://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/api/api/constants.py)) and ask the workers for updates if necessary.

The form of the data is:

```
{
    'body': data,
    'last_update': timestamp_isoformat
}
```

The workers are permanently reading the streams, which are in the same [consumer group](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro). You might read this script: [init.py](https://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/api/init.py).

When a worker receive a task, it makes HTTPS request to [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en) website and parse the result into JSON format inside [redis keys](https://redis.io/commands/getset).

## Before install

You need to create a discord bot here: [https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), get a token and replace it in `./bot_discord/bot/constants.py`.


## Simple configuration (1 worker)

### Install

```bash
 docker-compose up -d
```

## Advanced configuration (1+ workers)

- You can expose your redis by adding to redis service `docker-compose.yml`:
```
ports: 
    - 6379:6379
```
- If you want to deploy several workers you might need to modify [worker/main.py](https://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/worker/main.py), using the public ip where you deploy the redis container.

```python
app.redis = await aioredis.create_redis_pool(('PUBLIC_IP', 6379))
```

Then you can deploy a new worker separately using [worker/Dockerfile](https://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/worker/Dockerfile)

- If you have a physical interface which can be bind with different public IPv4 address:

1. Use the `docker-compose.yml` file from `advanced_configuration` folder

```bash
mv advanced_configuration/docker-compose.yml ./docker-compose.yml
```
You might need the attributes from the [docker macvlan network](https://docs.docker.com/network/macvlan/).


2. Details

This configuration avoids interfaces from backend network to get an access to internet, but we
want containers from this network to communicate together (api/redis/workers).

Every worker is bridged with a specific physical interface so that Root-Me detects those workers with different public IP. \ (We choose not to [rotate with proxies](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-rotate-proxies-and-ip-addresses-using-python-3/) for data privacy issues). 

*__Example__* (extract from [advanced_configuration/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/advanced_configuration/docker-compose.yml)):
```
bridge_worker:
  driver: macvlan
  driver_opts:
    parent: eth1
    macvlan_mode: bridge
  ipam:
    config:
      - subnet: 157.159.191.0/24
        gateway: 157.159.191.2
        ip_range: 157.159.191.56/29
```

If you deploy 6 workers (see "Install" subsection), the workers will take
`157.159.191.56-61` as IPv4 address thanks to `ip_range` attribute (those are
taken in ascending order in the subnet specified).

> Communication with the Docker host over macvlan.
> When using macvlan, you cannot ping or communicate with the default namespace IP address. For example, if you create a container and try to ping the Docker host’s eth0, it will not work. That traffic is explicitly filtered by the kernel modules themselves to offer additional provider isolation and security.

- [remove docker networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_rm/)


### Install

For 6 workers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale worker=6
```

Alternatively, you can use `docker-compose --compatibility up` with:

```
deploy:
  mode: replicated
  replicas: 6
```

It makes docker accept deploy section without using swarm.

### Result

```
docker ps

## [Discord Bot]

### Configuration

On your discord server you need to create a channel named `root-me-news` if you keep default configuration. You can change this channel name by updating the `bot_channel` value in [bot_discord/bot/constants.py](https://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/bot_discord/bot/constants.pyhttps://github.com/zteeed/Root-Me-API/blob/master/bot_discord/bot/constants.py).

### Database

A docker volume (local) is used for the bot database. You have a read/write access on the JSON file at 
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/root-me-api_discord_data/_data/data.json`

Info: `data.json` is not tracked by git on the local install.
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged bot_discord/data/data.json
```
